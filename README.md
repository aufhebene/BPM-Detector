# BPM Detector (Android)
BPM Detector is an Android application that detects the tempo or beats-per-minute 
(BPM) for a user's [conducting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting). 
Generally, the conductor moves their arms in a predictable pattern in order to maintain 
the band's synchronization, acting similarly to a metronome. The purpose of this application 
is to provide a tool for concert and marching band conductors to detect their precise tempo 
while conducting. This will help them determine how well they are coordinating the band and 
whether they need to adjust their conducting.

BPM Detector was originally created for Duc Dao's senior project at [Cal Poly](http://calpoly.edu/).
