# BPM Detector (Android)

BPM Detector is an Android application that detects the tempo or beats-per-minute
(BPM) for a band conductor's conducting. Generally, the conductor moves their arms in
a predictable pattern in order to maintain the band's synchronization, acting similarly to
a metronome. The purpose of this application is to provide a tool for concert and march-
ing band conductors to detect their precise tempo while conducting. This will help them
determine how well they are coordinating the band and whether they need to adjust their
conducting.

BPM Detector was created for Duc Dao's senior project at [Cal Poly](http://calpoly.edu/).
