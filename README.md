# CPE 491 - BPM Detector (Android)

The BPM Detector is an Android application that detects the tempo or beats-per-minute
(BPM) for a band conductor's conducting. Generally, the conductor moves their arms in
a predictable pattern in order to maintain the band's synchronization, acting similarly to
a metronome. The purpose of this application is to provide a tool for concert and march-
ing band conductors to detect their precise tempo while conducting. This will help them
determine how well they are coordinating the band and whether they need to adjust their
conducting.
